    Hallo travellers of the internet. If you are here, it is probably because of the Town or because I have scribbled the url to this website on some random place.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may notice that this website is, in fact, not complete. This is because the current owner of the website seems to be doing nothing abou it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please excuse him. This website may be updated eventually. That is all I had to say. Bye bye, and have fun on other Town member's websites. You're welcome for the merge conflicts, anonymous!
  </p>

Jello! I make some funny notes for things I find interesting or just for reference. Ignore the link below, only my joy for finally having a website.

- [delectable (Standard Model)](Physics/Standard_Model.md)
- [The Helpful Guide to using Logs in Nuclear Physics](Physics/Helpful_Guide_to_using_Logs_in_Nuclear_Physics)

Chemistry Notes:
- Work in progress! (I mostly write my notes for chemistry)
