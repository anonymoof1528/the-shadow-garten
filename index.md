    Hallo there people. If it wasn't obvious, this website seems to be a little bit broken. It is also a tad bit inactive, and incomplete. So, please tread carefully. There may be some loose floorboards, and the paint's still wet (somehow).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left; color: #657b83">
    Hopefully the owner of this website <span style="color: #93a1a1; font-size: 16px;">(anonymous135)</span> <b> FIXES IT ANY TIME SOON</b>.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left; color: #657b83">
    Anyways, that is all I had to say. You are welcome for the merge conflicts, anonymous.

Jello! I make some funny notes for things I find interesting or just for reference. Ignore the link below, only my joy for finally having a website.

I make notes on mostly science (physics & chem, anything else is terrible), literature and also Japanese (usually summaries). 

Physics Notes:
- [i need help (first physics CAP notes)](Physics/Linear_Motion_Notes.md)
- [yum (Waves investigation)](Physics/Waves_Evaluation_and_Analysis_Task_Research.md)
- [tastier (Waves Topic Test and Resonance Validation Test)](Physics/Waves_and_Resonance_Notes.md)
- [delectable (Standard Model)](Physics/Standard_Model.md)
- [The Helpful Guide to using Logs in Nuclear Physics](Physics/Helpful_Guide_to_using_Logs_in_Nuclear_Physics)

Chemistry Notes:
- Work in progress! (I mostly write my notes for chemistry)

Literature Notes:
- [rantsolve of Jekyll and Hyde?](Literature/I_hate_psychoanalysis_but_that_and_Jekyll_and_Hyde.md)
