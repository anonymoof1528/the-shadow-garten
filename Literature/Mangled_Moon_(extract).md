## Chapter 4 – Mea Trinitas Profana

The world looks white. A canvas, usually filled with vibrant colours that sprung towards me has white blotches dolloped across it. I try to think again and again, where am I? Where am I? In the array of my cacophonous thoughts, a soothing melody rings out from nearby. I could not mistake the cherry hue of my radio. The desk still cluttered with stationery, yet the cups remain in order. Violet, blue, green, yellow, orange and rose. Rose… Rose…

“Rose, dear? Please, dear God, help my Rose”, Mother begs desperately, shaking me.

I attempt to reply, but the words do not come out of my mouth. I reach in and embrace her, burrowing my face into her bosom.

“Rose! Oh, Rose, don’t you scare me like that”, Mother exclaims, and hugs me tightly.

A man I don’t know stands beside her, a smile plastered on his face like Betty told me. The way to tell between a plastered smile and a pure one is to see if the eyes, too, sparkle with the sentiment. I see no shine nor lustre in those blue beads above the fabricated grin that stretches from ear to ear. His burly form is barely contained in a white coat and smart dress. His tag is hidden behind a white blotch. I do not know this man. And yet I feel less than half the fear I had to even dare to glance at the men across from my row in church. It is strange and I wish it would not be this way. My mind wishes to stay away from him, to look away from him, to scorn him, but my body does not.

The man beams, words tumbling out of his piehole that I cannot decipher.

Another lady with bags under her eyes clad in blue scrubs approaches with various paraphernalia, imposing and striking them against my body; all feel cold, not one bit smooth nor rough. The metal that runs across my chest, the hammer against my knee, all too cold to feel anything else. A shudder runs down my spine with each touch.

Mother notices my discomfort and lays her warm hand upon my own.

“I put on your favourite Rose”, Mother croaks weakly, smiling purely, “for the Christmas spirit”.

The radio sings above my whitewashed room, making Mother and the other two people seem unmoving compared to the melody.

“Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright”

It certainly wasn’t night, all else but the radio seemed silent. My mind, too, clutters, in spite of this luminance.

And then I remember of Father. Every child has or had a father, as much as they have a mother.

“…Father?”, I just manage to mutter.

“He’s very busy, Rose”, Mother replies.

My mind begins to betray my body again. A feeling unknown to me creeps up, like a melting pot of molten metal, from within myself, the crucible.

“…helping people…?”, I croak.

“You could say that. He’s… talking… with some very important people”, Mother responds.

I tear my body away from her as the metal boils over.

Mothers’ eyebrows contort backwards, her beautiful smile slowly being drained as the corners of her mouth begin to fall. But then she too plasters a smile on her face while scoffing slightly, an attempt to laugh it off. I don’t remember Mother ever having a plastered smile before.

Mother attempts to reason “W- Well you know how he is dear… I-well-“, but the rest turns to incomprehensible stutters.

Mother strains her eyes towards the man and the lady, quickly rising from her chair and ushering the two towards the door, leaving me to myself.

The radio continues to sing “Silent night, holy night, shepherds quake at the sight, glories stream from heaven afar, heavenly hosts sing Alleluia”. It made me think of the Lord, of this ever glaring white, screaming not in praise of Him but of His power.

“Christ the saviour is born”

A darkness emerges from the white blotches. A form lay splay behind the dancing curtains. It leaps in from the windowsill, barely making a thud on the floor as it landed. The brown locks that glimmer not in the white, but shimmer from within the darkness. An inside beauty and luminescence, free from impurities. It was Betty.

“B- Betty? Where have you-”, I gasp, an itinerancy born within me to reach the darkness rather than my friend, Betty, her form untarnished by the blotches of white.

“I’ve been away. But you remain. They want to shut our w**re mouths, what’s the point?”, Betty snarls. The words strike as icicles colder than any of the instruments the lady, facing the window instead of me.

Betty continues, “That’s all they see us for. Didn’t you see his-“

“- plastered smile? I- I saw it just like you showed me Betty”, I reply, awestricken.

“I have to go Rose. You must find me”, Betty suddenly whispers. I can hear her as if she was in my ear from my bed. Betty’s frontier of untrust audibly crumbles.

“Betty?”

“You have to find me Rose. Please. Please help find me”, Betty pleads. I can almost hear tears in her voice.

In spite of her woes, the radio sung brighter, “Silent night, holy night”

And just as she came through the window, she falls face-first out of it. I scramble to look outside, but Betty simply isn’t there. I see no rungs leading to the second-story room. Betty is as athletic as I remember. I am beyond glad to see her again.

“Radiant beams from thy holy face, with the dawn of redeeming grace”, the radio proclaims. Then, nothing but a low growl exits the mouth of the radio. The rooms’ white is annihilated by an ever-growing black. I can hear conversation outside, my attention being drawn towards the door. I barely make out the light shining through for it to wade through the darkness. Passing by the desk, all but rose give into the ever-powerful dusk.

“I don’t know _what_ ice picks in brains do, but I am saying… no, I _know_ there is a difference between my Rose and whatever’s in her bedroom. I was near fainting from shock after… poor Betty”, Mother says. I imagine her grimacing, but what of me? What of Betty?

“I understand your concerns, Mrs Alton, but retrograde amnesia and personality shifts are common but usually temporary. Her prognosis shows no trace of her mental disorders”, I hear a monotony claims, proudly.

What of Betty? What of Betty?

I must find Betty. But this world looks ever so dark.
