title: Summary for Japanese writing
---

# HUGE WORK IN PROGRESS, PLEASE DON'T READ

So uh this is great. I have an essay to write within one hour for Literature, then I need to run to Mills and do this test which I have to write two different pieces, being two and a half pages in total. 

Wonderful. 

I love Perth Modern School. 

Anyway, less pain more summary.

UPDATE: That went better than I thought, mostly because I sacrificed some of Literature for Japanese. Meaning, I'm definitely getting better in Japanese compared to Lit, which is kinda better but 

## Writing test Topics
### アルバイトとお金 (Part-time jobs and Money)
### 旅行 (Travel)

## Part A - Stimulus Response
- Written in plain form, 250 - 300 ji/字 (if you don't know what ji is, you shouldn't be here)
	- For the space, you should generally follow these lengths:
		- Intro: 3 - 4 lines
		- Body para: 6 - 7 lines

Part A can be the easiest or the hardest for certain people, but it all depends on your reading ability. You are given a prompt (hence, a stimulus) which may be an **email, message, informal letter or blog post**. In this prompt, another person is addressing you about a certain topics listed above (it's very likely that it's the first, but nobody knows... except Todd-sensei).

There will also be ***questions directed to you that you must answer*** within your text. Your content is restricted, but some people like that since there's no need to memorise too much information (hence why it's the easiest for some). However, you must keep it very *short, succinct, responsive towards the person in the stimulus and with a fair amount of grammar structures* (hence why it can be the hardest for others). Below is a structure and summary of the types of texts for Part A

### Email/message/reply
- Your lucky (or unlucky) day! A person out there actually cares enough to send an email/message your way and you are to respond to their questions and concerns. The person can be Japanese or Australian, and the same goes for you.
- #### Structure
	- Salutation - top line, on the left side of the page (left-wing? [poggers poggers](../awakening.md))
		- 'person' へ
	- Introduction: one row below salutation, one space indent on the left side of the page
		- Address the person with saying '元気？', or if they ask it, say '元気だよ。'person' は？' (or not ~~to lose more space~~ and explain why),
		- Then you can address their concerns by making a generalised statement of what you are going to say
		- For example, if they say 'something' を教えて, then mention the something and say something like 教えてあげる
	- Body paragraph (only 1):
