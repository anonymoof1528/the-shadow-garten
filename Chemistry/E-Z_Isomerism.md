It certainly is not EZ (took a page out of your book Kento)

## Geometric isomerism

We know that isomers can either be structural or geometric, but what really is the difference? Structural isomers specifically compounds that have the same chemical formula but a different structure. Geometric isomers can technically be under this, but this relies on the *geometry* of a molecule; really only existing due to inability of double bonds to rotate around themselves like single bonds. Hence, there can be different isomers that have chains turned one way or another with double bonds.

We know, that as such, there exists ways of naming these isomers, which is using the IUPAC prefixes *cis* (same side; opposite) or *trans* (opposite sides; across). However, there are specific conditions that allow these prefixes to apply to the IUPAC name, shown below:
1. There are two different groups/species are bonded to one carbon atom in the double bond
2. The SAME two groups/species are bonded to the other carbon atom in the double bond
3.
