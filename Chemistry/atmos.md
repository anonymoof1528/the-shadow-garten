title: Vapourisation vs Aerosolisation

###### *beatboxing*

## Huh...

So a commit on that scale every week may have been a teensy bit much... not to mention an awfully scary ghost image (not an image of a ghost, an image that acted like a ghost) that seemingly kept appearing after I deleted it off the repo, but oh well (it's been fixed)! 
After my post-exam brain was recuperating, I came back to a thought that I had left behind in Year 11... which now after getting a whole lot better at Chem than I originally was, makes slightly more sense. 
People often know the word "*Aerosolisation*" from "*Aerosol cans*"... and, well, I did too until I realised... shocker!! It's behind the spreading of infectious diseases?? That's crazy talk. Anyway..

## Vapourisation

Vapour is often known as a state of matter between liquid and gas, or a gas of a certain substance below the boiling point of that substance. Or, in Physics terms, the *critical temperature* of a substance. 
And boy oh boy there's a lot of debate on that. Here are a few thoughts on that:

* A vapour is a gas
* Vapour is not a gas, and a gas is not vapour
* A glass is a liquid (???)

Let's depart from the odd thoughts that physicists often have. If you're into that... then you can read the OW-esque ramblings of Mr Tatum graciously provided by Libretexts [here](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Thermodynamics_and_Statistical_Mechanics/Heat_and_Thermodynamics_(Tatum)/06%3A_Properties_of_Gases/6.04%3A_Gas_Vapour_Liquid_and_Solid). 
However, vapours are formed through evaporation, which is thought to be represented through the vapour form of a substance being in equilibrium with either the solid state or liquid state of that same substance. It isn't exactly a state of matter, but rather a diffusion of the solid or liquid state of the substance into a space of air; in essence, it's a 
mixture, as shown below.

$$\text{H_2O_{(l)}} \leftrightharpoons \text{H_2O_{(v)}}$$

The equilibrium between water and water vapour, denoted with the (v) symbol (*not exactly as a state symbol*).

Vapours *cannot exist* without the presence of the solid or liquid form of a certain substance, as as a product, similar to in other equilibria, requires the presence of every reactant in the specific stoichiometric ratio to form (though in this case it's just one mole of 
water so you'll get water vapour forming from any amount of water or ice).

Tomorrow

I'm going on with this tomorrow dw I'll be back

Aerosolisation is quite the funnies but I gotta test out the Katex for a bit
